Last semester I took an image processing class and looking at this 'videogrep' concept really brings up some memories. I got this idea when reading through HackerNews last week. I stumbled across these two posts about videogreping. [Videogrep: Automatic Supercuts...](http://lav.io/2014/06/videogrep-automatic-supercuts-with-python/) and [Some more Videogrepping...](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/06/21/some-more-videogreping-with-python/).

What I would like to do is have some kind of automatic editing of video based on some kind of computer vision. (Really specific goals, I know) Using a couple different python libraries, I think once we come up with a goal and fully fledged idea, I will try to write more about it and describe how we are acomplishing what we do.
