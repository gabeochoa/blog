This project is a pygame (Python) project started by a friend Brett. His plan was to recreate the generation 3(?) games in pygame to learn about games programming and flex his python muscles. When I joined the project he had I believe about 6k lines of code.

Check it out on [github](https://github.com/B1anky/Pokemon-Game)

(This is what I first saw when he booted it up)

For this project, the main thing I have worked on is the basic player movement and the screen camera. In the pokemon franchise the movement is one that is both real time and grid based. This poses a problem of allowing the player to continue moving fluidly while stopping on a grid when input is ceased.&nbsp;

(Here is a webm of what I implemented, still working on the scrolling camera)
